* This is still a WIP
Syntax highlighting and indentation still need a bit more testing and fine tuning,
sometimes when writing some egregious Odin code Emacs will crash? lockup? but most
of the time it should be fine.

* odin-ts-mode
A Major mode for Emacs >= 29.1 powered by tree-sitter for editing odin files.

** Requirements
Emacs >= 29.1 compiled with tree-sitter.

The grammar utilized for this major-mode can be found at https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-odin.

To install it you can add this line to your `treesit-language-source-alist`:
#+begin_src elisp
  (defvar treesit-language-source-alist
    '(...
      (odin "https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-odin")
      ...))
#+end_src
Afterwards run M-x treesit-install-language-grammar RET odin RET.

** TODO Roadmap? [2/3]

- [X] Indentation
  - [ ] Make sure everything is good
